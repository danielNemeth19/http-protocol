TCP
- run tcplistener and redirect its output:
go run ./cmd/tcplistener | tee /tmp/tcp.txt
- run this command from other shell - netcat will transmit the message with 1 second timeout time:
printf "Do you have what it takes to be an engineer at TheStartupâ„¢?\r\n" | nc -w 1 127.0.0.1 42069

TCP: UDP sender
- run udp sender:
go run ./cmd/udpsender
- in separate terminal run - this starts up a upd listener (-l option):
nc -u -l 42069
- messages sent in the udp sender terminal should appear in the other one

Requests: TCP to HTTP
- run the tcplistener and redirect its output:
go run ./cmd/tcplistener | tee /tmp/rawget.http

- from another shell send a GET request to it:
curl http://localhost:42069/coffee

- the request will hang since TCP listener only listens but request will come in
